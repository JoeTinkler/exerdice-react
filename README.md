# Exerdice

A dice rolling / activity tracking web app. Let the dice decide the duration of your daily activities and keep track of your progress.

Created in [React](https://react.dev/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)/[Vite](https://vite.dev/) using [SQLocal](https://sqlocal.dev/) to store data locally in the browser origin private file system.

Designed to used on mobile devices
